# Write a program which asks a user for their age and lets them know if they can or can't vote in the following 
# three fictional countries.
# Around the world, different countries have different voting ages. In the fictional countries of Peturksbouipo, 
# Stanlau, and Mayengua, the voting ages are very different:
# the voting age in Peturksbouipo is 16 (in real life, this is the voting age in, for example, Scotland, Ethiopia,
# and Austria)
# the voting age in Stanlau is 25 (in real life this is the voting age in the United Arab Emirates)
# the voting age in Mayengua is 48 (in real life, as far as we can tell, this isn't the voting age anywhere)
# Your code should prompt the for their age and print whether or not they can vote in Peturksbouipo, Stanlau,
# or # Mayengua.
# Here's a sample run of the program (user input is in blue):
# How old are you? 20 You can vote in Peturksbouipo where the voting age is 16. You cannot vote in Stanlau where 
# the voting age is 25. You cannot vote in Mayengua where the voting age is 48.
