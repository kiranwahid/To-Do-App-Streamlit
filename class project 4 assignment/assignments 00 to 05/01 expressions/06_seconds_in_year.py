# Use Python to calculate the number of seconds in a year, and tell the user what the result is in a nice
# print statement that looks like this (of course the value 5 should be the calculated number instead):

# There are 5 seconds in a year!

# You should use constants for this exercise -- there are 365 days in a year, 24 hours in a day,
# 60 minutes in an hour, and 60 seconds per minute.

days_in_year = 365
hours_in_day = 24
minutes_in_hour = 60
seconds_in_minute = 60

# Calculate the number of seconds in a year
second_in_year = days_in_year* hours_in_day* minutes_in_hour* seconds_in_minute

# Print the result

print(f"There are {second_in_year} seconds in a year!")
